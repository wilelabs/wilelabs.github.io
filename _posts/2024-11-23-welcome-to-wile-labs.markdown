This is our first post to introduce the world to Wile Labs. We are a small group of people dedicated to expanding science, math, and philosophy lieracy through the blending of technology, art, and education. We are passionate stewards of the environment, especially the oceanic world, and we also try not to take ourselves too seriously. We hope to build out this concept, site, and ideas in the comming months.

You can check out our code at [GitHub](https://github.com/wilelabs).
